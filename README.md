# Supermarket Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes supermarket sales data to uncover insights into branch performance, customer behavior, and product sales trends. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, cleaned using Python, and visualized through Power BI to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI → For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing sales insights.
- Python (Pandas, NumPy) → For data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathered raw data, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key trends in sales, customer behavior, and branch performance.
3. Power BI Dashboard Development: Built interactive visuals to analyze revenue distribution, top-selling products, and promotional impact.

## Key Insights & Analyses
- Sales Performance Analysis → Evaluated revenue trends across branches and time periods.
- Product & Category Analysis → Identified best-selling and least-selling products to optimize inventory.
- Customer Behavior Insights → Analyzed purchasing patterns and peak shopping hours.
- Branch Performance Assessment → Assessed revenue distribution, discount effectiveness, and sales impact.

## Key Features of the Dashboard
- Dynamic Filtering → View sales data by branch, category, product, and time period.
- Interactive Visuals → Graphs, heatmaps, and KPIs for data-driven decision-making.
- Actionable Insights → Recommendations for improving marketing strategies and stock management.
